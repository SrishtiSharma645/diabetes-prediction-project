Diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

**Objective**
We will try to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

**Features**
Pregnancies : Number of times a woman has been pregnant
Glucose : Plasma Glucose concentration of 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure : Diastollic Blood Pressure (mm hg)
SkinThickness : Triceps skin fold thickness(mm)
Insulin : 2 hour serum insulin(mu U/ml)
BMI : Body Mass Index ((weight in kg/height in m)^2)
Age : Age(years)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction : scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
Outcome : 0(doesn't have diabetes) or 1 (has diabetes)


**Benefits**
This diabetes prediction model offers several advantages:

Early Detection: Identify people at high risk for diabetes, enabling earlier intervention.
Improved Management: Help healthcare professionals tailor treatment plans based on risk.
Reduced Costs: Early detection can potentially lower healthcare costs associated with diabetes.
Increased Awareness: Raise awareness about diabetes risk factors and encourage healthier habits.
